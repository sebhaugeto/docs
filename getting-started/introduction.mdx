## What's Dealflow?

I'm glad you asked! Dealflow is a next-gen invoicing tool for global companies. It finally solves the headache of international bank transfers via IBAN / SWIFT by giving each Dealflower access to **local bank accounts** in the country of their customer.

This becomes possible because of our **invoicing with local accounts** feature. Here's a full 2 minute demo of how this works:
