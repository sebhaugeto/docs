## Introduction
The Dealflow API allows you to build your own financial AI agent with invoicing capability and more. Here's how to technially get started.

1. Go to the API plugin
2. Click the "API Keys" button. You will be redirected to the API section in the copmany setttings page. 
3. Click the "Create API Key" button
4. Enter the API key name (used for display purposes only)
5. Select the scopes you would like this API key to have
6. Press the "Create" button
7. Copy the key and store it in a secure place
8. For security reasons, the API key will be displayed only once, and there is no way to recover it if you loose it.


All API endpoints are authenticated using "auth method incoming".

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": [incoming]
  }
]
```
