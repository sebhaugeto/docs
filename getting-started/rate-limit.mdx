title: 'Rate limits'
description: 'Dealflow has a few API limits to ensure safe usage for everyone. Here is what you should know.'

## The limits

1. Not more than 100 requests in 10 seconds 
2. Not more than 600 requests in 60 seconds 

That's it. Short and clear.

## Breaking the limit

If you exceed the limit, the API request will fail with the 429 status code.

## How to stay within the limit
1. Run your automations multiple times a day, instead of running your automations once per day. This will reduce the number of requests per minute. 
2. Split your API calls into batches and apply a wait time between batches. That way, you will reduce the number of requests per minute. 
3. Use AI to restructure your code to fit into our rate limits. Just send the AI this page for context, then request the changes.
